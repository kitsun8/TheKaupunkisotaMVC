An Overwatch custom tournament/league website sample. Works with the same Database as K8Directoriino, and updates are obviously shown instantly because of this.

Includes:
- Information about tournament
- Scoreboards
- List of played matches with scores and Map drafts
- List of Upcoming matches
- Teams participating in the tournament/league
- A convenient refresh button that only fetches the divs without reloading the whole page

Theme of this Bootstrap-based page is called "Greyscale" by Startbootstrap. https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/
